# A Little About Applied Customization:

this repository is just a WordPress site that fully customized to be a website about movies info (like IMDb).
- I use **unite** theme for this site, for modify this theme, I create a **child-theme** to prevent loosing my customization in updating main theme.
- in this site, we need four new taxonomies for movie's **Genre, Country, Year, Actor**, I have 2 choices, installing plugin or write a simple plugin, I choose second choice and write a small plugin for creating these taxonomies and showing them in wp-admin and in WordPress front theme.
- in this site, we need a new post type named **Films** to separate blog posts from Films posts. so I write a plugin for this new post type.
- at last, we need 2 custom fields for **Release Date** and **Ticket Price:** and I add these wp-admin and in WordPress front theme.
